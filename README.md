# GroupMe-Kickout
Bot that kicks out unwanted people from GroupMe groups when they join (alleviates the problem of them leaving, and so are unable to be kicked).

You are free to use this software on your own server. If you would like to use the functioning app right now, a hosted version is available for free [here](http://gm-getout.herokuapp.com).
